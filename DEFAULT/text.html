De Verrekijker is an open and autonomous place on campus, existing since VU conceded the locale to squatters in May 2015. We have no rules except don't be an asshole. Coffee is free and beer is cheap, but we appreciate donations. If you're in luck there's also food available. We run on volunteer basis; noone gets paid so don't expect good service or broad menus. If you clean up after yourself you'll make us very happy. We like the concepts of sharing, trust and kindness, and so we have racks of clothes for you to take from and add to, and drawers full of tools and materials that you can use for your cool projects. If you look around you'll probably find other objects of interest as well. We host events of various kinds sometimes, including discussion groups and parties. You're welcome and encouraged to <b><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe_zm8Hpga7YRd-D5lcWZU1RXoauezNNycTyWhKXQdLENl5LA/viewform">organize any non-profit and non-exclusive events in our locale</a></b> as well! For the most recent updates about what's going on, find us <b><a href="https://www.facebook.com/deverrekijkervu/">on facebook</a></b> or come by and have a chat with us. Don't be shy, we try hard to be nice to everyone who walks in. You can reach us by email at <b><a href="mailto:de.verrekijker.vu@gmail.com">de.verrekijker.vu@gmail.com</a></b>, but it's not checked every day. If it's urgent, it's best to come by in person. Google has kindly plotted us on their <b><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/De+Verrekijker/@52.333419,4.8629908,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47c60a085459df69:0x2293a00c7f66cb6e!8m2!3d52.333419!4d4.8651795">map, to help you find the way</a></b>. We're open more or less every day, whenever someone who has a key is here.
